NOAUTOPATH

 NOAUTOPATH keeps man from automatically adding directories that look like
 manual page directories to the path.

NOAUTOPATH

 NOCACHE keeps man from creating cache pages ("cat pages")
 (generally one enables/disable cat page creation by creating/deleting
 the directory they would live in - man never does mkdir)

 Useful paths - note that COL should not be defined when NROFF is defined as "groff -Tascii" or "groff -Tlatin1";
 not only is it superfluous, but it actually damages the output.
 For use with utf-8, NROFF should be "nroff -MANdoc" without -T option.
 (Maybe - but today I need -Tlatin1 to prevent double conversion to utf8.)

 If you have a new troff (version 1.18.1?) and its colored output
 causes problems, add the -c option to TROFF, NROFF.

 The comMANd "MAN -a xyzzy" will show all MAN pages for xyzzy.
 When CMP is defined man will try to avoid showing the same
 text twice. (But compressed pages compare unequal.)

CMP		/usr/libexec/man-cmp.sh

 Compress cat pages

COMPRESS	/usr/bin/lzma
COMPRESS_EXT	.lzma

 Default manual sections (and order) to search if -S is not specified
 and the MANSECT environment variable is not set (1x-8x sections are used by
 xorg packages).

MANSECT		1:1p:8:2:3:3p:4:5:6:7:9:0p:n:l:p:o:1x:2x:3x:4x:5x:6x:7x:8x

 Default options to use when man is invoked without options
 This is mainly for the benefit of those that think -a should be the default
 Note that some systems have /usr/man/allman, causing pages to be shown twice.

 Enable/disable makewhatis database cron updates.
 If MAKEWHATISDBUPDATES variable is uncommented
 and set to n or N, cron scripts 
 /etc/cron.daily/makewhatis.cron
 /etc/cron.weekly/makewhatis.cron
 will not update makewhatis database.
 Otherwise the database will be updated.

This file is also read by man in order to find how to call nroff, less, etc.,
and to determine the correspondence between extensions and decompressors.
