 man.conf from man-1.6f

 For more information about this file, see the man pages man(1)
 and man.conf(5).

 This file is read by man to configure the default manpath (also used
 when manpath contains an empty substring), to find out where the cat
 pages corresponding to given man pages should be stored,
 and to map each PATH element to a manpath element.
 It may also record the pathname of the man binary. [This is unused.]
 The format is:

 MANBIN		pathname
 manpath		manpath_element	[corresponding_catdir]
 manpath_MAP		path_element	manpath_element


 If people ask for "man foo" and have "/dir/bin/foo" in their PATH
 and the docs are found in "/dir/man", then no mapping is required.

 This file is also read by man in order to find how to call nroff, less, etc.,
 and to determine the correspondence between extensions and decompressors.

 MANBIN		/usr/local/bin/man

 Every automatically generated manpath includes these fields

manpath	/usr/man manpath
manpath	/usr/local/share/man
manpath	/usr/X11R6/man

 Uncomment if you want to include one of these by default

 manpath	/usr/share/*/man
 manpath	/usr/kerberos/man

 Set up PATH to manpath mapping

 If people ask for "man foo" and have "/dir/bin/foo" in their PATH
 and the docs are found in "/dir/man", then no mapping is required.

 The below mappings are superfluous when the right hand side is
 in the mandatory manpath already, but will keep man from statting
 lots of other nearby files and directories.

manpath_MAP	/bin			/usr/share/man
manpath_MAP	/sbin			/usr/share/man
manpath_MAP	/usr/bin/mh		/usr/share/man

 NOAUTOPATH keeps man from automatically adding directories that look like
 manual page directories to the path.

 NOCACHE keeps man from creating cache pages ("cat pages")
 (generally one enables/disable cat page creation by creating/deleting
 the directory they would live in - man never does mkdir)

 Useful paths - note that COL should not be defined when
 NROFF is defined as "groff -Tascii" or "groff -Tlatin1";
 not only is it superfluous, but it actually damages the output.
 For use with utf-8, NROFF should be "nroff -mandoc" without -T option.
 (Maybe - but today I need -Tlatin1 to prevent double conversion to utf8.)

 If you have a new troff (version 1.18.1?) and its colored output
 causes problems, add the -c option to TROFF, NROFF.

TROFF		/usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc
